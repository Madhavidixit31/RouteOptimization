# Shipping Route Optimization Project

This project focuses on optimizing shipping routes between multiple US cities using real-world data and big data simulation. It leverages Google Maps Distance Matrix, Weather APIs, and generates large-scale shipping data (~20GB) to analyze, optimize, and visualize efficient delivery paths.

## Summary
1. **Fetch Real Data**: Uses Google Maps API and Weather API to generate a real-world distance matrix.
2. **Generate Big Data**: Creates a large (~20GB) shipping dataset with added weather and traffic impact.
3. **Analyze & Optimize**: Performs EDA, visualizes data, and applies various optimization algorithms (Greedy TSP, Genetic Algorithm).
4. **Weather & Traffic Considerations**: Adjusts routes based on real-time data.
5. **Final Route Solution**: Identifies the optimal delivery path using real-time adjusted distances.
